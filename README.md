- 👋 Hi, I’m Melissa Buckingham
- I am the owner of Melissa Buckingham Web Development (MBWD), I have received awards for my work, and graduated with a distinction from the Code Institute and the North East Surrey College of Technology (NESCOT). I build unique websites that are sure to grab the attention of any prospective clients.
The Internet is a continuously growing domain with more and more businesses launching into the virtual realm. Along with many different programming languages and different frameworks that are available, it can be very complicated for new businesses to create a trustworthy online presence. With 27.7 million Web Developers globally and 4.7 million in the UK (as of 2021, that number having doubled in the 10 years prior) experienced web developers are in high demand, often chosen by clients as a sure way to build a professional website, as opposed to just making a cheap website from the likes of Wix or GoDaddy.
My business provides services such as Website building, Web management, Search Engine Optimization, Word of Mouth through social media, Android and IOS app building and marketing, Database building and management, and Ecommerce website building and management.
The company’s values are: Diligence, Efficiency, Concision, and Perfection. Meaning that our clients can expect a high standard throughout. They can also expect the job to be completed within a prespecified time scale. Finally, the client can expect all code to be succinct and to the point, so that the purpose for the code is clearly visible to any other developer who may work on the project at any future occasion.
As the owner of the company, I will personally see that the work we do for you will be completed to the highest possible standard.
